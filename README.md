## Product Description:
We are CovidBuddy, a web application seeking to help fund institutions at the center of the pandemic by encouraging social productivity. While brainstorming for the theme Hacking Forward, the idea of creating a platform to help keep days happier while still keeping progress with our pre-covid goals emerged. Thus was CovidBuddy created, in hopes of helping users stay productive but still keep in touch with loved ones.


## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs):

**Q:** How does the point system work?  
**A:** You earn points by completing tasks on our website. Linking with a new friend gives you 5 points, video calling a friend for 10 minutes gives you 5 points, checking a to-do item gives you 1 point. If a friend verifies that you’ve completed a to-do item, you earn 10 points! The points can later be translated to donations to charities or just stored in your account.

**Q:** Do I have to make a donation?
**A:** No! You can either choose to use points for donation or simply collect those points and receive a weekly productivity statistical report!

**Q:** Can I gift my points to someone else?
**A:** Sorry, we don’t currently have that function. Perhaps in the future!

**Q:** Is there a deadline by which I need to use my points?
**A:**  Nope! You are free to keep saving your points for however long you would like!

**Q:** Can I use CovidBuddy without creating an account?
**A:** Yes, you are still able to browse through articles to stay informed, join our newsletter to receive monthly updates, and track your to-do items under Productivity. However, we encourage you to create an account to earn points, link with friends, and hold each other accountable and motivated!

**Q:** I do not want to connect with new friends. Can I still use CovidBuddy without my information being sent to strangers?
**A:** Yes! Our Let’sLink function is completely optional, and CovidBuddy will not send your information to anyone without your permission.

**Q:** I have already connected with a couple friends. I would not like to continue being connected.
**A:** No worries! You can remove your survey information anytime under Profile, and we will stop linking you with new friends!

**Q:** My interests changed. Can I change my previous survey information so I can meet new friends who match my new interests?
**A:** Yes! You are free to edit your survey information under Profile.

**Q:** Do friend connection invitations expire?
**A:** No, but we do recommend you accept any friendly looking invitations as soon as possible to meet your new friend! Who knows, maybe they will become a lifelong good friend!

**Q:** Will there be a mobile version of CovidBuddy?
**A:** Not currently, but possibly in the future! Join our mailing list to keep up with CovidBuddy’s latest updates!
